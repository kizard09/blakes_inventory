# Description:
# Inventory system should track the inventory count of 4 items.
# The program should output the current items in a numbered
# list, and their current counts to the screen and then prompt
# the user to enter which item should be edited. After the user
# chooses the item to edit, the users should be allowed to enter
# a new inventory count for the item.

# item1 = "shoes"
# item2 = "socks"
# item3 = "belts"
# item4 = "hats"

#This prints the current inventory at the beggining.
#Every item will have a quantity of 0 at this point.
